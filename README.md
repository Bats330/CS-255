# CS-255
The purpose of the project is to create a new system for the company DriverPass. They want their system to be able to provide training/practice for individual that are preparing for their driving test. They will do this through assistance in studying for their lessons or through in person driving lessons. They wanted there system to be a nice and simple interface for users to see and update their driving progess.

The parts I did particular well would have to be developing and understanding the clients needs and being able to create and meet the functional requirements for the client by assing what they needs.

The part I would like to revise would probaly have to be my diagrams in project two I feel that I can probaly clean them up and work on some of the wording that was used
And just generally expand further into them to make them more comprehendable and precise to what we were trying to accomplish with the project.

I interpreted and implemented the user needs into the project by going through the interview transcript and looking at what the client wanted exactly out of this system
I then worked on coming up with functional requirements that were inspired or directly related to those requirements from the clinet along with coming up with limitaions for our system based on the clients requirements for example the time restraint and the inclusion of all web based browser being able to work.

I approach designing software in a step based process I like to gain infromation on what we are going to be working on and what sort of things I need to start planning out
My next step is creating flowcharts and diagrams to create a idea of all the pieces I will be needing for my system I then work on integrating those needs into a actuall
program and then work on testing these are all teqniques I will continue to build appon and use for the future.
